# Project README: Real-Time News Aggregator and Recommender System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Real-Time News Aggregator and Recommender System. It is designed to fetch news articles from various online sources, categorize them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and recommend articles to users based on their reading history and preferences. The system combines the latest advancements in web scraping, data science, machine learning, and NLP to provide a personalized news reading experience.

## Features

1. **News Aggregation**: Collects real-time news data from multiple sources using web scraping techniques or APIs.
2. **Content Categorization**: Utilizes NLP to categorize news articles into different genres or topics.
3. **User Reading History Tracking**: Keeps a record of articles read by users to understand their preferences.
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Implements machine learning algorithms to recommend articles that align with user interests.
5. **Interactive User Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to read and interact with news articles.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **Scrapy/BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping (if scraping is the chosen method of data collection).
- **NewsAPI**: For fetching news articles (if API-based collection is preferred).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLP Libraries (NLTK/spaCy)**: For processing and categorizing text content.
- **Machine Learning Libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch)**: For developing the recommendation algorithms.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **Flask** (optional): If a more traditional web application is desired.
  

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python libraries.
3. **API Keys**: Obtain necessary API keys (e.g., NewsAPI) and configure them as per the documentation.
4. **Run the Application**: Execute the Streamlit app or Flask server (as per your setup).

## Usage

1. **Access the Web Interface**: Open the Streamlit app or Flask-based web application.
2. **Browse Articles**: View the list of aggregated news articles.
3. **Read & Interact**: Read articles and interact with the content for the system to learn your preferences.
4. **Get Recommendations**: Based on your reading history, the system will recommend articles.
